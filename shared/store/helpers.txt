Youâ€™re dealing with occasional updates (routes, places, shops)
and many users reading the same data, not writing constantly.

ðŸ‘‰ So the best design is:

Hybrid caching + background auto-refresh

Implementation idea:

Store lastFetchedAt and lastUpdatedAt for each dataset.

When user loads data:

Use cached version instantly.

In background, do a light Firestore check (using a small query with orderBy('updatedAt', 'desc') limit(1)).

If Firestoreâ€™s updatedAt > local cacheâ€™s lastFetchedAt, re-fetch fresh data silently and update the store.
